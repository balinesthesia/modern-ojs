# Modern Open Journal Systems (MOJS) [Archived]

This repository began as an exploration of a modern publishing platform, initially forked from [Open Journal Systems (OJS)](https://github.com/pkp/ojs) by the [Public Knowledge Project (PKP)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/). We’ve since fully rewritten and renamed it to **Modern Journal Systems (MJS)** at [balinesthesia/mjs](https://github.com/balinesthesia/mjs) to reflect its new identity and direction.

## Why the Change?
OJS has been a cornerstone for scholarly publishing, and we’re deeply grateful to PKP for its pioneering work. However, as we stand in 2025, the rapid pace of technological evolution—think AI-driven workflows, real-time scalability, and decoupled architectures—demanded a ground-up rethink. The shift from PHP to a modern stack (React, Rust, Python) wasn’t just a preference; it was a necessity to meet today’s publishing challenges, like integrating advanced AI for peer review or handling global submission spikes. With no reusable code from OJS’s PHP base and no practical way to contribute upstream, we realized MJS needed to stand as a distinct project—building on OJS’s spirit, not its foundation.

See [balinesthesia/mjs](https://github.com/balinesthesia/mjs) for the latest updates as we shape this new path forward!
