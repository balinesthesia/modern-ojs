# Modern Open Journal Systems (MOJS)

Welcome to Modern Open Journal Systems (MOJS), an open-source evolution of scholarly publishing!

MOJS is a fork of [Open Journal Systems (OJS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/), originally developed by the [Public Knowledge Project (PKP)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/). Maintained by [Balinesthesia](https://website.anestesiudayana.com/), we’re reimagining OJS with a modern stack: React with TypeScript and Next.js for a dynamic frontend, Rust for a high-performance backend, and Python for AI-driven features like peer review matchmaking.  

As of April 2025, MOJS is in early development—join us to shape its future!
