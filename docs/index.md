# Modern Open Journal Systems (MOJS) Documentation

Welcome to the MOJS Documentation Hub!  

MOJS is under active development as of April 2025 and not yet ready for use. Our full documentation—including the Admin Guide, Getting Started guide, and more—will be available here at [balinesthesia.github.io/docs](https://balinesthesia.github.io/docs) upon our first release.  

For now, follow our progress and contribute at [github.com/balinesthesia/modern-ojs](https://github.com/balinesthesia/modern-ojs).
