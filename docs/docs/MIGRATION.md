# Migration Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating from OJS to MOJS.

## Overview

The migration process is divided into several phases to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining data integrity and system availability.

## Migration Phases

### 1. Pre-Migration Preparation
- [ ] Audit current OJS installation
  - [ ] Document current version
  - [ ] List installed plugins
  - [ ] Review custom configurations
- [ ] Data inventory
  - [ ] Document database schema
  - [ ] List file storage locations
  - [ ] Review user data structure
- [ ] Feature parity analysis
  - [ ] Compare OJS and MOJS features
  - [ ] Identify gaps
  - [ ] Plan workarounds

### 2. Data Migration
- [ ] Database migration
  ```bash
  # Export OJS data
  pg_dump -U ojs_user ojs_db > ojs_backup.sql

  # Transform data
  python scripts/transform_data.py ojs_backup.sql mojs_data.sql

  # Import to MOJS
  psql -U mojs_user mojs_db < mojs_data.sql
  ```
- [ ] File migration
  ```bash
  # Export files
  rsync -avz /ojs/files/ /mojs/files/

  # Verify integrity
  python scripts/verify_files.py
  ```
- [ ] User migration
  - [ ] Export user data
  - [ ] Transform user roles
  - [ ] Import to Keycloak

### 3. Feature Migration
- [ ] Core features
  - [ ] Journal setup
  - [ ] User management
  - [ ] Submission workflow
- [ ] Advanced features
  - [ ] Review system
  - [ ] Statistics
  - [ ] Search functionality

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Data validation
  ```bash
  # Run validation scripts
  python scripts/validate_data.py

  # Check data integrity
  python scripts/check_integrity.py
  ```
- [ ] Feature testing
  - [ ] Automated tests
  - [ ] Manual testing
  - [ ] User acceptance testing

### 5. Go-Live Preparation
- [ ] Final data sync
- [ ] DNS updates
- [ ] SSL certificate setup
- [ ] Monitoring configuration

### 6. Post-Migration
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] Issue resolution
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Database Rollback
```bash
# Restore OJS database
pg_restore -U ojs_user -d ojs_db ojs_backup.sql
```

### 2. File System Rollback
```bash
# Restore files
rsync -avz /mojs/files_backup/ /ojs/files/
```

### 3. DNS Rollback
- Revert DNS changes
- Update SSL certificates
- Restore old configuration

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Data Testing
- [ ] Data integrity checks
- [ ] Relationship validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### 2. Feature Testing
- [ ] Core functionality
- [ ] User workflows
- [ ] Integration points

### 3. Performance Testing
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Stress testing
- [ ] Scalability testing

## Monitoring

### 1. System Health
- [ ] Resource usage
- [ ] Error rates
- [ ] Response times

### 2. Data Integrity
- [ ] Regular checks
- [ ] Automated validation
- [ ] Alert system

### 3. User Experience
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Error tracking
- [ ] User feedback

## Support Plan

### 1. Pre-Migration
- [ ] User communication
- [ ] Training materials
- [ ] Support team preparation

### 2. During Migration
- [ ] 24/7 support
- [ ] Issue tracking
- [ ] Communication channels

### 3. Post-Migration
- [ ] User support
- [ ] Issue resolution
- [ ] Documentation updates
